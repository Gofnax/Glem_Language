**Data Types:**<br>
In Glem we support the usage of integers and boolean values.<br/>
With this, you can use basic arithmetic operations:
* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)
* Division (integer division) (/)
* Modulo (%)

and boolean operations:
* AND (&&)
* OR (||)
* NOT (!)

As such, you can also use comparison operations:
* Equality to (==)
* Not queal to (!=)
* Greater than (>)
* Less than (<)
* Greater than or equal to (>=)
* Less than or equal to (<=)

The basic way to make use of Glem is to write one-line expressions,<br>
to which to interpreter will print the result.
For example:
```
>>> 3 + 5;
8
>>> 12 >= 4;
true
>>> 4 * (5 + 2);
28
```
